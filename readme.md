`OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"`

Replace `"your_openai_api_key_here"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

Here's an example of what the `.env` file could look like:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key_here"
```

Make sure to replace `"your_openai_api_key_here"` with your actual OpenAI API key.

After creating the `.env` file, you can run your Streamlit app using the following command:

```
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start your Streamlit app and load the API key from the `.env` file.
